The ks-dock library
=======

This library has a dependency on the [ks-core lib](https://github.com/ks-frontend/ks-core).

The dock library is a dockbar with a specific theme. Although it is configurable and you can easily extend from its functions, you should consider if the code you will overwrite is not more than what the library contains.

The point of the ks-framework is to avoid having unused code into your projects which makes it easier to maintain and make it evolve.

# Installation with bower

```console
$ bower install ks-dock
```
