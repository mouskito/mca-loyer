# The ks-base file structure

This repository is the basic skeleton for developping plugins for the ks-frontend-framework. 

It is not an obligation but just a little bit less of file creation.

All plugins can be totally independent of the framework.

This repository's bower.json contains the dependency of the framework's core.

# Install with bower

```console
$ bower install ks-base
```
