The ks-normalize library
=======

This library has a dependency on the [ks-core lib](https://github.com/ks-frontend/ks-core).

Although we import a normalize library, this one deals with some specifics with our own styling. You should extend from this normalize if you intend to add some more normalize stuffs to normalize your developpement.

# Installation with bower

```console
$ bower install ks-normalize
```
