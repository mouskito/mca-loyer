CORE.JS
=======

The core.js is a small lib which pricipally does only one thing. It compares a given element (which can be either a class or a property) with a given array("actionRules"). If there is a there is a match, it will call a function depending on the class or property name with two parameters: the class if there is a parameter attached to it and the element's object.

# Installation with bower
