# The ks-buttons library

This library is dependent of the ks-core library.

This library is mostly a couple of pieces of codes, mixin, variables and jquery function which are too small and common to put in a seperate library but which may cause conflicts in an existing project. 

It contains for example float left and right, clearfix etc...

Have a look at the code to get a better idea.

# Installation with bower

```console
$ bower install ks-components
```
